# `cardbleed`: Create image bleed from image
Command-line application to create card images with bleed from PDF.

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-python-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/)

`cardbleed` is a command-line tool to create images with bleed from a
PDF of card images. This is useful for preparing print-ready sheets
of cards (such as for tabletop games or trading card prototypes),
where each card image in a PDF needs to be processed to add a "bleed"
margin for proper printing and cutting.


## Features

* Extracts individual card images from a PDF file.
* Adds bleed margins to each card image for print safety.
* Outputs processed images for professional-quality print preparation.


## Installation
`cardbleed` can be run by entering a hatch environment and then
running the program.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jrsmith3/cardbleed.git
cd cardbleed

hatch shell
pip install -e .

cardbleed -h  # Prints the help message and exits.
```


## Usage

```bash
python cardbleed.py input.pdf --bleed 0.125 --output-dir output/
```

* `input.pdf`: Path to your source PDF containing card images.
* `--bleed`: (Optional) Bleed margin to add in inches (default:
  0.125).
* `--output-dir`: (Optional) Directory to save the processed images
  (default: `output/`).


### Example

```bash
python cardbleed.py mycards.pdf --bleed 0.125 --output-dir cards_with_bleed/
```
